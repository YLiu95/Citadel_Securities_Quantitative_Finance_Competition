# Citadel Securities Quantitative Finance Competition



## Achievement Highlights
As the winner of the Citadel Securities Quantitative Finance Contest, I leveraged advanced technical skills to develop a winning trading strategy that automated the market-making process with object-oriented programming. Here are some technical details that showcase the complexity of the achievement:

1. Developed an algorithm that used object-oriented programming to automatically create a bid-offer spread around the reference price, using sophisticated quantitative techniques to provide an optimal trading experience.
2. Implemented a sophisticated pricing model that provided a 2% non-skewed bid and offer for each trade, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy and precision in the market-making process.
3. Skewed the prices based on the position of risk at any given moment in time, incorporating a 1% - 7% skewed bid or offer that reflected the hedge fundsâ€™ exposure of risk, a critical consideration in a competitive trading environment.
4. Created a quoted trade object to send quoted trades to the hedge funds, demonstrating a high level of technical expertise in developing complex trading systems.
5. Developed a market maker object that kept a log of the quoted trades, client responses, and completed trades, showcasing a sophisticated approach to tracking and analysing trading data.
6. Visualised all the quoted trades completed for the tickers as well as the Bid, Offer and Reference Price against Date, providing a comprehensive view of the trading process that showcased exceptional technical skills in data visualisation and analysis.
